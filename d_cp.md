The diagram above shows the process of making the concrete and its main component cement.

Overall, cement production is a highly complicated process, combining various technologies, while concrete is a result of mixing everything at once.

The first stage of making a cement is combining limestone and clay in a grinder. This allows to crush those components into a powder, which later will go trough the mixer to blend them into a more consistent structure. Penultimate step in a process of making the most complicated concrete part is to heat up an existing powder in a rotating heater. The result is then put on the grinder to separate the cement from large uncrushed stones. Usually the cement is put into the bags for transportation purposes.

Produced cement is later used in the making of concrete. The final result is a combined mixture of various materials, such as sand, gravel, water and cement. The first ones combine for 75 per cent of the concrete. After the addition of cement the structure is moisturised and mixed until it becomes a concrete.
