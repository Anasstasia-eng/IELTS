In the modern day and age, where technologies allow humans to do wonderful things: from flying to the Mars to exploring depths of the ocean, having an accommodation may still be a problem for a decent number of people. In this essay I will examine the problem of housing and come up with a reasonable solutions.

Current problems with housing have began in the 18th century. Industrialisation revolutionised the way how people live, bringing masses from distant villages to big cities. This fast growth in population led to the lack of accommodations and the ashes of this problems remain today. In some countries villagers are unable to have a moderately paid job or an expected quality of life and hence forced to come to nearby cities looking for working opportunities and therefore housing.  However, this only creates the issue of overpopulation. While building rates with todays technologies are amazing and are catching up with the demand, prices for new flats and houses could create a challenge for potential buyers.

To fight with the overpopulation and to prevent large groups of people coming to cities, it is important to encourage citizens to go to or stay in the village. This is a common practice in large countries, such as Russia or China, where workers of various important profession are paid to stay in the distant areas. Such an approach can spread the population all across the country emptying up the cities. And with drop of demand, the prices will be adjusted for everyone to afford their own place to stay.

While humanity is focusing on the technological progress, there are a lot of people who have basic issues, such as housing. People coming far-away areas overpopulate the cities and skyrocket the demand for accommodation. The government must create new policies encouraging citizens to back to the country, freeing up megapolises.
