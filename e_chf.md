Other people believe that it is important for children to make decisions about matters that affect them.

Raising children is one of the hardest and most important tasks for humanity, however there are different ways of doing so. One group of people believes that it is important to take control over kids choices, while others allow children to make their own decisions. In this essays I will discuss both sides and give my own opinion.

On the one hand there are people who believe that it is important for parent give the freedom to their kids. Supporters of such approach assume that if child is given freedom they will grow up more independent and self-sufficient. These qualities can be extreme important later on during their adulthood, in some cases increasing the quality of live and its longevity. A great example in this case is Daniel Kirsch from the game Catherine, who while being an orphan became a powerful heir to a large corporation. Depending on himself and having an endless freedom made him one of the most powerful humans in the city.

On the other hand freedom given to the young ones might sometimes harm their personality and affect their future decisions. If person is achieving everything on their own and relying just on themselves they a more likely to be more egoistic, ignoring others needs. The consequences of this upbringing method could be seen everywhere nowadays. A lot of parents who chose work over children are battling with their self-centric heirs who were being forced to act freely.

Society depends on the future generations hence raising children must be the most prioritised task for humanity. However, it is extremely important to maintain balance in freedom that is given to kids. I personally believe that it is better to give more freedom to children than to restrain them.
